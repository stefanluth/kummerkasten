# FAQ

## What is the Kummerkasten?

In environments where open communication is valued, there may still be moments when some questions or views may not want to be expressed directly. This could be due to concerns about possible reactions or discomfort with certain topics.

In such cases, the Kummerkasten provides a trusted platform where people can share their thoughts in a secure environment.

## How does the Kummerkasten work?

The Kummerkasten is an anonymous message board where people can ask questions, express opinions and give feedback without coming out of the closet.

The posts are not moderated, but the right is reserved to remove posts that violate [the rules of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## How do I use the Kummerkasten?

You do not need to register or sign up. You can simply write a post on the [Start page](/) and click on **Submit**.

## I don't see any posts. What do I have to do?

You need to enter the password on the [Unlock page](/unlock) to unlock the posts.

## Where do I get the password?

The password should be communicated to you by a person who has access to the Kummerkasten or published in another communication channel that is accessible to you.

This ensures that only authorized persons have access and that anonymity is maintained.
It is important not to disclose the password to unauthorized third parties.

## How can I report a post?

When you want to report a post, you can use the Report link above the post. If a post is reported often, it will be hidden at first and then possibly removed if it violates [the rules of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

Until then, reported posts can be viewed on the [Reported page](/reported).

## How can I delete my post?

Posts cannot be deleted. If you want to delete your post, you can report it and it will be removed if it violates [the rules of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## Why can't I delete my post?

Posts cannot be deleted to ensure anonymity, as it cannot be traced who wrote the post.

## How can I edit a post?

Posts cannot be edited for the same reason they cannot be deleted.

## How can I share a post?

You can share a post by clicking the **Copy Link** button below the post. This will copy the link of the post to your clipboard.

## How can I rate a post?

You will find an up arrow and a down arrow next to each post. If you click on one of the arrows, your rating will be saved.

## How can I reply to a post?

This feature is not yet available. Work is being done to implement it as soon as possible. Until then, you can copy the post ID starting with &apos;#&apos; above the headline to mention it in your reply.

## <a name="markdown">How can I format the content of my post?</a>

Posts support [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Some parts of [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) are also supported.

Unsupported elements include HTML tags, images, linked texts, footnotes, sub- and superscript, definitions, and emoji. The reason for this is that these elements endanger anonymity, could lead to abuse, or are simply not meaningful.

## How can I be sure that my posts and ratings are anonymous?

No IP addresses or other data that allow conclusions about your identity are stored. Only the posts that are published and the ratings that are given are stored.

## If no data is stored and no registration is required, can't the posts be manipulated?

Correct. It is trusted that users will handle this tool responsibly. The Kummerkasten is not intended for public use, but for a specific group of people who have access to the password.

## <a name="fingerprint">The source code mentions a 'Fingerprint'. What is that?</a>

The fingerprint is a kind of ID that is generated from your browser and device configuration. This information itself is not stored, only the hash generated from it.

It prevents multiple voting and recognizes spam without storing IP addresses or other data that allow conclusions about your identity.

## But the source code mentions an IP address. Is my IP address stored after all?

No, your IP address is not stored. The IP address is used to generate the hash, which is called a fingerprint. The IP address itself is not stored and cannot be associated with your posts or ratings.

## Is the Kummerkasten connected to company XY?

No, the Kummerkasten is an [open source hobby project](https://github.com/stefanluth/kummerkasten). It is not connected to any company and was only developed for exchange with colleagues.
